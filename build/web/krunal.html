<h2>Krunal-A Dream Come True</h2>   
        <p> <br/>F2S: Can you tell us about the interview process?

<br/>Krunal:Google conducted APAC test for 2015 graduating students in Asia pacific regions. I was 8th overall and 2nd in India after Divanshu. I was called for interviews at Google Bangalore office after that. I had 4 interviews in total and all of them were based on data structures and algorithms. A few basic questions were also asked from OS.

<br/>F2S: Can you give us a brief account of what you felt was the toughest interview?

<br/>Krunal:According to me all the interviews were of similar difficulty level. They were testing different domains in Algorithms and Data structures. The last interview was relatively at a bit higher difficulty level.

<br/>F2S: What was your preparation strategy?

<br/>Krunal:I revised all my computer science CDCs before the placement season started. Lecture slides were good enough for that. I prepared for the GATE exam in the beginning of the year and it saved a lot of time for me during placement season. In my last 4 years my goal was to learn as many new technologies as possible. I gained introductory knowledge in web designing, Machine learning, Network Science, Application development etc. Apart from that I regularly practiced on codechef and topcoder to improve my programming and problem solving skills. I also thoroughly revised my projects which were mentioned in my resume before the interviews.

<br/>F2S: What kind of skills do you think helped you getting this job?

<br/>Krunal:Mainly programming skills. I like participating in various programming contest and it improved my knowledge in algorithms as well as my programming skills. For eg. I learned to spend more time in designing the solution than in coding. Special thanks to my friend N Hari Prasad (Google Hyd) who guided me all the time.

<br/>F2S: What resources did you consult? Where did you practice problems from?

<br/>Krunal:For my computer science subjects I mainly used my textbooks and lecture slides. For Algorithms I used Cormen and various tutorials on internet.

<br/>F2S: How was Competitive Programming in the interview?

<br/>Krunal:By participating in such competitions and practicing in F2S2>, I improved in terms of speed , Accuracy , Efficiency , and problem solving approaches. All of them plays crucial role in interviews where we are asked to design and code the solution for an unseen problem

<br/>F2S: Were grades a factor in you getting selected?

<br/>Krunal:Google asked for my grade sheet after all the interviews were over. Hence it was part of their review process. Good grades always make a better impression.

<br/>F2S: What’s your advice to students who are aiming for similar placement offers as yours?
<br/>Krunal:
<br/>1) Writing code after you solve a question or learn a new data structure or algorithm is equally important. Make a habit to write neat and readable code as that helps your entire team. Make sure you get your code reviewed. In case of programming puzzles, see the setter’s solution.

<br/>2) Attend your classes regularly.

<br/>3) Find your passion and never give up on it. Rest all follows.

<br/>4) Keep yourself updated with new technologies.
